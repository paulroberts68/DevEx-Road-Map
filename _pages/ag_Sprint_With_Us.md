---
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	As a public sector program owner I should be able to field up to 50% of my sprint team (2-4 team members) from a team that is operating in the private sector, in a near-instant manner, and continue that engagement as long as it is needed so that I can quickly, and continuously, improve my program and its services 

2.	As a small team of skilled individuals operating in the private sector I should be able to join a sprint team for a BC public sector program owner in a near-instant manner and be able to continue the engagement as long as it is needed so I can help them quickly and continuously improve their program and its services
